This training dataset is just for simpler tests. The images are from the KITTI dataset stereo pair images,
disparity calculated with Efficient Large-Scale Stereo Matching Algorithm (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-19315-6_3)

In the video demo we have used the CityScapes dataset depth maps, which are denser and have more frames.
